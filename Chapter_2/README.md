## Observer Pattern 
**Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern**
It is similar to the newspaper subscriptions, only here we call the publisher the **SUBJECT** and the subscribers the **OBSERVERS**.

### Definition
The Observer Pattern defines one-to-many dependency between objects so that when a change of state occurs the dependents are notified and updated automatically.
